> We have discussed about the stair case problem in the [Solved Example Folder](https://github.com/ISTE-VIT/The-Algo-Companion/tree/main/DYNAMIC%20PROGRAMMING/SOLVED%20EXAMPLES) wherein we have to find the number of ways by which we can reach the top most stair provided, 
provided we can take 1 or 2 steps at a time.

> Device an algorithm for the same question, but now you can take 1,2,3 or 4 steps at a time.
